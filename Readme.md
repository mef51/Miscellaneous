=============

I push stuff here. 
Little exercises and fun stuffs mostly.

* `DateDice.java` : Roll dates like dice!
* `Resistance.java` : Takes colors finds resistance. Is futile
* `MultiplesOfThree.java` : Did you know that all numbers whose digits add up to three are divisible by 3?
* `LinearAlgebraMain.java` : nanananana BATMAN
* `package mef.parentkid` : I saw a kid playing in the snow unsupervised and thought of something, so I went to code about it. Note to self: check priorities.
